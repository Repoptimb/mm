        <h1>Dear Trisha,</h1>
        <p>You are incredibly important to
me, more than words can express. I promise not to let you down. Together, we will strive harder towards our goals and navigate through any challenges that come our way. I vow to be more mature, serious, and dedicated towards you and my preparations. I will never doubt my worth or our love again, keeping my promise to you.</p>
        <p>Let's move past this rough patch and focus on the bright future ahead. We have an exciting journey ahead of us, filled with hard work, tough questions, and the pursuit of excellence. We understand each other better than anyone else, and together, we can overcome any obstacles.</p>
        <p>During moments of burnout or loneliness, let's lean on each other for support. Our love fuels us to wake up every day knowing there's someone who cares deeply for us. Together, we can maintain our mental well-being and stability.</p>
        <p>I know sometimes we misunderstand each other in the heat of the moment, but communication is key. I encourage you to share your thoughts and feelings openly with me, so we can work together to strengthen our bond.</p>
        <p>Let's commit to helping, loving, and caring for each other, both in our studies and in our relationship. By giving each other the attention and support we need, we can avoid unnecessary conflicts and grow stronger together.</p>
        <p>In your heart's tender plea,<br>
        I see your doubts, but believe me,<br>
        In your eyes, I find it clear,<br>
        Our love, boundless and sincere.</p>
